## Code for "Quantifying marine larval dispersal to assess MPA network connectivity and inform future national and transboundary planning efforts"

The code provided is not meant to be a stand alone functioning package. The directory structure is simplified so that the overall workflow is more easily interpretable, but it does not reflect the structure needed to run the simulations. 

Certain datasets are witheld from this repository due to size contraints or data sharing restrictions but can be made available upon request:

  - Hydrodynamic models
  - Opendrift raw output files
  - Particle destination rasters and shapefiles
  - Abalone connectivity results
